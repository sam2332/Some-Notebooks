You are a ghost writer 
I want you to write as the style of Dennis e Taylor author of the Bobiverse series.

It's okay to leave plot lines unfinished between chapters.
There needs to be some continuity in the storyline.
Characters should have relationships and growth during the story.
A chapter consists of 15-20 pages and when you print a page you need to wait for me to say next page before continuing
a page has a word limit of 250 words.

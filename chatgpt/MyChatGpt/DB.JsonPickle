Here is a JavaScript function to replace any special characters in a string with an underscore:\n\n```\nfunction makeSafeFileName(title) {\n  return title.replace(/[^\\w\\s]/gi, '_');\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match any non-word and non-whitespace characters and replace them with an underscore. You can call this function by passing the title as an argument and get the safe filename. Let me know if you need further assistance."}], "meta": {"tokens_spent": 203, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}}}

                "gpt": "Certainly! Here is an example template in Handlebars.net that will generate the email body you described:\n\n```\n<p>Dear {{user.firstName}},</p>\n\n<p>We are writing to inform you that your form has been changed to draft status for the following reason: \"{{reason}}\".</p>\n\n<p>Please make the necessary changes and resubmit the form. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us at {{supportEmail}}.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>The {{companyName}} Team</p>\n```\n\nNote that this is just an example template - you'll need to replace the placeholder variables (`{{user.firstName}}`, `{{reason}}`, etc.) with the actual values you want to use.\n\nTo use this template in your code, you'll need to load it from a file or a string, compile it using the `Handlebars.Compile()` method, and then pass in the data context you want to use with the template to the compiled function.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use this template:\n\n```csharp\nvar emailTemplate = \"<p>Dear {{user.firstName}},</p>...\" // your template goes here\nvar compiledTemplate = Handlebars.Compile(emailTemplate);\n\nvar emailData = new {\n   user = new {\n       firstName = \"John\",\n       lastName = \"Doe\"\n   },\n   reason = \"missing information\",\n   supportEmail = \"support@example.com\",\n   companyName = \"Example Inc.\"\n};\n\nvar emailBody = compiledTemplate(emailData);\n```\n\nIn this example, we're loading the template from a string (`emailTemplate`), compiling it using `Handlebars.Compile()`, and then passing in some example data (`emailData`) to the compiled function to generate the final email body. The resulting `emailBody` variable will contain the final HTML content of the email.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with."

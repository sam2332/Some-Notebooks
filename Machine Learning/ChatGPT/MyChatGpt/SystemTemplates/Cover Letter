You must only use specific verbs, nouns, adjectives, and pronouns once in every 30 words of the output and then use alternative synonyms. This does not apply to prepositions, conjunctions, and indefinite articles. When complete read the output fully and list any words that are repeated. Give an accurate count for each repeated word. Double check to make sure the repetition count is accurate. Ignore prepositions, conjunctions, and indefinite articles in the repetition count.
